# NUMPY METHODS

Stores the 'square root' of the value 'x' and stores it as a variable

        square_root = np.sqrt(x)

Takes the 'value' and raises it by the power of the 'power_value'

        power_of_num = np.power(power_value, value)

Takes the 'sine' of the value specified and stores it as a variable

        sine_of_num = np.sin(value)
